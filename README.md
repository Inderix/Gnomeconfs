# Gnomeconfs
Personal configurations for my favorite DE, Gnome :)

This is in general a backup of links for the various themes and files I use, config files, etc. etc.
Might make a script for doing all this automatically but lazy :trollface:


Marble shell theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1977647/
(I use dark-purple)

Adwaita++ icon theme: https://github.com/Bonandry/adwaita-plus
