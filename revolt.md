# Revolt colorscheme
I'll probably add this to Revolt's in-built Discover themes section, but for now I'll store it here.

## Basics 
(Copy, then use the "Import theme" button in Revolt's appearance settings)
```{"accent":"#9c54b5","background":"#141315","foreground":"#F6F6F6","block":"#2b2a2c","message-box":"#141315","mention":"#1f1125","success":"#3ABF7E","warning":"#FAA352","tooltip":"#000000","error":"#F84848","hover":"#1c1920","scrollbar-thumb":"#9c54b5","scrollbar-track":"transparent","primary-background":"#141315","primary-header":"#231f27","secondary-background":"#141315","secondary-foreground":"#C8C8C8","secondary-header":"#2D2D2D","tertiary-background":"#2b2a2c","tertiary-foreground":"#848484","status-online":"#3ABF7E","status-away":"#FAA352","status-focus":"#4799F0","status-busy":"#F84848","status-streaming":"#977EFF","status-invisible":"#A5A5A5","light":false,"css":".coVeIl {\noverflow-y: unset;\n}\n","font":"Roboto","monospaceFont":"Ubuntu Mono"}```

## CSS
(Paste in custom CSS section)
(All it does is fix the voice UI)
```.coVeIl {
overflow-y: unset;
}```
